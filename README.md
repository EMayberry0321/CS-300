# CS-300
Repository made for CS 300 course at SNHU
-------------------------------------------

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
With these projects, we were to design and implement code to create an advising assistance software. We were to create a data structure to hold
course information and print out selected courses based on searchy criteria.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
To approach the solution for our given programming "problem", I created a pseudocode for each data structure and performed a runtime analysis
to gauge which structure would be most efficient to use on the real code. I created a pro/con list for each structure to assist in further
investigating their efficiencies.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
Any roablocks or issues I stumbled into with this problem were easily solved by asking others familiar in the language, or by doing searches
in our textbook as well as other reading materials. This allowed me a window into other ways this could be solved and provided me with a
better understanding of what I did to get myself "stuck"

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
This project allowwed me to see outside of the lines. I was able to understand that there are several different ways to approach problem
solving, and that there isn't always just one "right" way to do it. It allowed me to see that having to look for help and do a bit of
research on your own isn't a bad thing and doesn't make you a weak coder, but instead does the opposite, so long as you are open to 
learning new things.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
This project helped me to finally see the value of in-line comments. It finally opened my eyes as to why it is always a great idea to leave
not just yourself, but others who you may work with, small insights as to what each portion of your code is doing to increase your own efficiency
in the event you need to take a break or put the project down for a few days.
